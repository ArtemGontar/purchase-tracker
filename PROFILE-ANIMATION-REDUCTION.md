# Profile Screen Animation Reduction

## Changes Made

### Before (Heavy Animations):
- Multiple staggered entrance animations with complex delays
- Individual `SlideInRight` animations for each setting item
- `FadeInDown` + `FadeInUp` combinations
- Spring physics on all animations
- 6+ animated components with delays from 200ms to 1200ms

### After (Minimal Animations):
- Only 3 simple `FadeInUp` animations
- Removed all individual item animations
- Simplified entrance timing (100ms, 200ms, 300ms)
- Removed footer animation completely
- Clean, subtle entrance without overwhelming motion

## Animation Summary:

1. **Profile Header**: `FadeInUp.delay(100)` - Quick, subtle entrance
2. **Settings Card**: `FadeInUp.delay(200)` - Gentle appearance
3. **Actions Section**: `FadeInUp.delay(300)` - Final element entrance
4. **Footer**: No animation - Static appearance

## Benefits:
- ✅ Faster perceived loading time
- ✅ Less visual distraction
- ✅ More professional, subtle feel
- ✅ Better for users sensitive to motion
- ✅ Improved performance with fewer animations

The ProfileScreen now has a clean, minimal animation approach while maintaining the modern feel of the app.
