# Purchase Tracker MVP Skeleton

## Product Overview

**Purchase Tracker** is a minimal, functional MVP application that:

- Scans a paper receipt üì∏
- Runs OCR to extract structured items
- Saves data to the cloud
- Displays purchase history in the app

---

## 1. Core MVP Idea

**One simple feature:** Take a photo of a receipt ‚Üí Instantly get a "purchase" in the app with date, store, item list, prices, and total.

**MVP Goal:** Prove that users will actually save receipts and that data can be reliably parsed.

**Focus:** Minimal UX friction, fast response, cross-platform (iOS + Android).

---

## 2. Architecture & Technologies

### üì± Client (Mobile App)
- **Framework:** React Native (fast, cross-platform, camera access). Alternative: Flutter, but RN integrates easier with JS backend.
- **UI:** Minimalist ‚Äî list of receipts + scan screen.
- **iOS/Android Optimization:**
  - Use native camera modules (expo-camera or react-native-camera)
  - Auto-cropping guidelines for receipts
  - Local photo caching before upload

### ‚òÅÔ∏è Backend & Cloud (AWS)
- **API Gateway + AWS Lambda (Node.js/Python):** Serverless backend
- **S3:** Store original receipt photos
- **DynamoDB:** Purchases database (flexible, key-value, cost-effective)
- **Cognito:** User authentication
- **Amazon Textract:** OCR for receipts (extracts text, items, prices)
- **Amazon Comprehend / Custom Parser:** Extract structured data (store, date, items, prices)

---

## 3. MVP Mini-Architecture (Flow)

1. User takes a photo of a receipt
2. Frontend sends photo to API Gateway ‚Üí Lambda
3. Lambda stores photo in S3
4. Lambda calls Textract ‚Üí gets text
5. Parser (in Lambda) converts text to JSON (store, date, item list)
6. JSON saved to DynamoDB
7. Mobile app fetches and displays purchase list

---

## 4. Data Model (Minimal Schema)

**Purchases Table (DynamoDB):**

```json
{
  "purchaseId": "uuid",
  "userId": "uuid",
  "date": "2025-08-27T12:34:56Z",
  "storeName": "Carrefour",
  "items": [
    { "name": "Milk", "price": 1.20, "quantity": 1 },
    { "name": "Bread", "price": 0.80, "quantity": 1 }
  ],
  "total": 2.00,
  "rawText": "original OCR text",
  "imageUrl": "s3://bucket/..."
}
```

---

## 5. UI Skeleton

### "My Purchases" Screen
- Feed with receipt cards: store, date, total
- Tap for details (items)

### "Scan Receipt" Screen
- Camera with hint: "Point at the receipt"
- Button: "Take Photo"

### "Profile" Screen (Minimal)
- Logout button

---

## 6. Roadmap: First Steps

**Step 1. Infrastructure Skeleton (1 week)**
- Set up AWS project (API Gateway + Lambda + DynamoDB + S3 + Cognito)
- Configure CI/CD (e.g., AWS Amplify or GitHub Actions)

**Step 2. Mobile App (1‚Äì2 weeks)**
- React Native skeleton (Tab Navigation: Home / Scan / Profile)
- Camera screen ‚Üí photo ‚Üí send to API
- Purchase list screen (empty placeholder)

**Step 3. OCR & Parsing (1‚Äì2 weeks)**
- Integrate Textract ‚Üí get raw text
- Write simple parser: extract date, total, items via regex
- Save to DynamoDB

**Step 4. Integration & Display (1 week)**
- Fetch receipts from DynamoDB ‚Üí show in app
- Receipt details (items, total, date)

**Step 5. Mini-Optimization**
- Local purchase list caching (AsyncStorage)
- Photo compression before upload

---

## 7. Second Iteration (If MVP Succeeds)
- Automatic import from e-receipts (QR code from fiscal receipt ‚Üí tax API, where available)
- Item categorization (dairy, bread, meat)
- Mini-analytics (top items, weekly spend)
- Push notifications (e.g., "Don't forget to save your receipt!")

---

## Summary

**MVP = React Native app + AWS (Textract, S3, DynamoDB, Lambda, API Gateway, Cognito).**

User ‚Üí photo of receipt ‚Üí OCR ‚Üí JSON ‚Üí display in purchase feed.
