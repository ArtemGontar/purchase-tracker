# Infrastructure as Code: From 'It Works on My Machine' to AWS Free Tier Glory ‚òÅÔ∏èüèóÔ∏è

Time to talk about everyone's favorite topic: infrastructure! üéâ (Okay, maybe not everyone's favorite, but stick with me here.) We're going to build a production-ready AWS infrastructure that won't cost you a penny for the first 12 months, and barely anything after that. Think of it as getting a Ferrari for the price of a bicycle ‚Äî except the Ferrari runs in the cloud and never needs gas money.

## Why Infrastructure as Code? Because Clicking Buttons is for Chumps üñ±Ô∏è

Let's be honest: the AWS console is like a maze designed by someone who clearly never had to find their way out in a hurry. Sure, you *could* click through 47 different screens to create an S3 bucket, but why would you when you can write some code and let the computer do all the clicking for you?

**Infrastructure as Code benefits:**
- **Repeatable** üîÑ ‚Äî Deploy the same thing 100 times without crying
- **Version controlled** üìù ‚Äî Git blame your infrastructure mistakes
- **Documented** üìö ‚Äî Your code IS the documentation (when done right)
- **Testable** üß™ ‚Äî Because `terraform plan` is better than "let's see what happens"
- **Collaborative** üë• ‚Äî No more "works on my AWS account" problems

## OpenTofu vs Terraform: The Plot Twist Nobody Saw Coming üé≠

Here's where things get spicy. You've probably heard of Terraform ‚Äî it's like the cool kid everyone wants to hang out with. But then HashiCorp went and changed their licensing, and suddenly using Terraform in production might cost you money. Enter **OpenTofu**, the hero we needed but didn't know we wanted.

**OpenTofu is basically Terraform's cooler, more generous sibling:**
- ‚úÖ **Completely free** (like, actually free forever)
- ‚úÖ **Open source** (community-driven, not corporate-driven)
- ‚úÖ **100% compatible** (same syntax, same providers, same everything)
- ‚úÖ **Better governance** (no surprise license changes)
- ‚úÖ **Active development** (because open source never sleeps)

**Migration is literally this easy:**
```bash
# Old way
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply

# New way
tofu init
tofu plan
tofu apply
```

It's like switching from Pepsi to Coke, except both taste exactly the same and one doesn't randomly change its recipe and charge you for it.


## AWS Free Plan Update (2025): What You Need to Know üí∞

As of **July 15, 2025**, AWS introduced a new Free Plan policy for new accounts. Instead of the old 12-month free tier, new users now get a credit-based plan with a 6-month window and some service restrictions. Always-free services remain available for everyone.

For this project, the following AWS services are always-free (within their limits):

- **AWS Lambda:** 1 million requests + 400,000 GB-seconds/month
- **Amazon S3:** 5 GB Standard storage
- **Amazon DynamoDB:** 25 GB storage + 25 read/write capacity units
- **Amazon CloudFront:** 1 TB data out + 10 million requests/month
- **Amazon SNS:** 1 million publishes/month

If you need more resources or want to avoid account closure after 6 months, consider upgrading to a paid plan. For legacy accounts (created before July 15, 2025), the old 12-month free tier still applies.

## Our Infrastructure: The Dream Team Assembly ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

We're building the Avengers of cloud infrastructure:

```
üì± Frontend (React Native)
    ‚Üì "Hey, I need to store this receipt!"
üåê Backend (Node.js + Express)
    ‚Üì "Let me talk to my friends..."
üîê Cognito (Authentication)
    ‚Üì "Who goes there?"
üì∏ S3 (File Storage)
    ‚Üì "I'll keep that safe!"
üëÅÔ∏è Textract (OCR Magic)
    ‚Üì "I can read that!"
üóÑÔ∏è DynamoDB (Database)
    ‚Üì "I'll remember everything!"
```

Each service plays its part in this beautiful symphony of modern cloud architecture. It's like a well-rehearsed orchestra, except instead of music, we get scalable applications.

## The OpenTofu Configuration: Where Magic Happens ‚ú®

Our infrastructure is organized like a well-planned city:

```
infrastructure/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.tf              # The city center (main config)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ variables.tf         # The settings panel
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ outputs.tf          # The information desk
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ modules/            # Specialized districts
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cognito/       # Authentication district
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ s3/            # Storage district
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dynamodb/      # Database district
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ iam/           # Security district
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ scripts/           # The maintenance crew
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ setup.sh       # "Build the city"
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ deploy.sh      # "Update the city"
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ destroy.sh     # "Evacuate the city"
```

**Main configuration that doesn't make you cry:**
```hcl
# main.tf - The heart of our operation
terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "~> 5.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "aws" {
  region = var.aws_region
  
  default_tags {
    tags = var.tags
  }
}

# Cognito for authentication (because passwords are hard)
module "cognito" {
  source = "./modules/cognito"
  
  project_name   = var.project_name
  environment    = var.environment
  user_pool_name = var.cognito_user_pool_name
  tags           = var.tags
}

# S3 for file storage (because hard drives are so 2005)
module "s3" {
  source = "./modules/s3"
  
  project_name = var.project_name
  environment  = var.environment
  bucket_name  = "${var.s3_bucket_name}-${random_id.suffix.hex}"
  tags         = var.tags
}

# DynamoDB for data persistence (because data matters, and JSON is life)
module "dynamodb" {
  source = "./modules/dynamodb"
  
  project_name = var.project_name
  environment  = var.environment
  table_prefix = var.dynamodb_table_prefix
  tags         = var.tags
}
```

**The beauty is in the simplicity.** Each module handles its own complexity, and the main file just orchestrates the symphony.

## Cognito Module: Authentication Without the Headache üîê

Remember the old days of storing passwords, handling forgot-password flows, and crying into your keyboard at 3 AM because someone got hacked? Yeah, Cognito fixes all that:

```hcl
# modules/cognito/main.tf
resource "aws_cognito_user_pool" "main" {
  name = "${var.project_name}-${var.environment}-users"

  # Email-based authentication (because usernames are confusing)
  alias_attributes = ["email"]
  username_attributes = ["email"]

  # Password policy (because "password123" isn't secure)
  password_policy {
    minimum_length    = 8
    require_lowercase = true
    require_numbers   = true
    require_symbols   = false  # Don't torture your users
    require_uppercase = true
  }

  # Email verification (because trust, but verify)
  auto_verified_attributes = ["email"]
  
  # Welcome message that doesn't suck
  verification_message_template {
    default_email_option = "CONFIRM_WITH_CODE"
    email_message        = "Welcome to Purchase Tracker! Your verification code is {####}"
    email_subject        = "Your verification code"
  }
}

# User Pool Client (the app's key to the kingdom)
resource "aws_cognito_user_pool_client" "main" {
  name         = "${var.project_name}-client"
  user_pool_id = aws_cognito_user_pool.main.id

  # No secrets for mobile apps (because security best practices)
  generate_secret = false
  
  # Authentication flows that actually work
  explicit_auth_flows = [
    "ALLOW_USER_SRP_AUTH",
    "ALLOW_REFRESH_TOKEN_AUTH",
    "ALLOW_USER_PASSWORD_AUTH"
  ]

  # Token settings (not too short, not too long)
  access_token_validity  = 1    # 1 hour
  id_token_validity     = 1    # 1 hour
  refresh_token_validity = 30   # 30 days
}
```

**What this gives us:**
- User registration and login ‚úÖ
- Email verification ‚úÖ
- Password reset ‚úÖ
- Secure token management ‚úÖ
- MFA support (if you want it) ‚úÖ
- Zero password storage headaches ‚úÖ

## S3 Module: File Storage That Doesn't Hate You üì¶

S3 is like that reliable friend who never loses your stuff and always knows where you put things:

```hcl
# modules/s3/main.tf
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "receipts" {
  bucket = var.bucket_name
}

# Encryption (because security matters)
resource "aws_s3_bucket_server_side_encryption_configuration" "receipts" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.receipts.id

  rule {
    apply_server_side_encryption_by_default {
      sse_algorithm = "AES256"  # Free tier compatible
    }
  }
}

# CORS for web/mobile access (because browsers are picky)
resource "aws_s3_bucket_cors_configuration" "receipts" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.receipts.id

  cors_rule {
    allowed_headers = ["*"]
    allowed_methods = ["GET", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE", "HEAD"]
    allowed_origins = ["*"]  # Restrict in production
    max_age_seconds = 3000
  }
}

# Lifecycle policies (because storage costs money eventually)
resource "aws_s3_bucket_lifecycle_configuration" "receipts" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.receipts.id

  rule {
    id     = "cost_optimization"
    status = "Enabled"

    # Intelligent tiering (let AWS optimize costs for you)
    transition {
      days          = 0
      storage_class = "INTELLIGENT_TIERING"
    }

    # Clean up incomplete uploads (because nobody likes clutter)
    abort_incomplete_multipart_upload {
      days_after_initiation = 1
    }
  }
}
```

**Smart features included:**
- Automatic encryption ‚úÖ
- Cost optimization ‚úÖ
- CORS configuration ‚úÖ
- Lifecycle management ‚úÖ
- Public access control ‚úÖ

## DynamoDB Module: Database That Scales (And Costs Nothing to Start) üóÑÔ∏è

DynamoDB is like having a filing cabinet that magically expands when you need more space, reorganizes itself for optimal performance, and costs virtually nothing until you're processing millions of receipts:

```hcl
# modules/dynamodb/main.tf
resource "aws_dynamodb_table" "users" {
  name           = "${var.table_prefix}-users"
  billing_mode   = "PAY_PER_REQUEST"  # Pay only for what you use
  hash_key       = "id"

  attribute {
    name = "id"
    type = "S"
  }

  attribute {
    name = "cognitoId"
    type = "S"
  }

  global_secondary_index {
    name     = "CognitoIdIndex"
    hash_key = "cognitoId"
  }

  tags = var.tags
}

resource "aws_dynamodb_table" "receipts" {
  name           = "${var.table_prefix}-receipts"
  billing_mode   = "PAY_PER_REQUEST"
  hash_key       = "id"

  attribute {
    name = "id"
    type = "S"
  }

  attribute {
    name = "userId"
    type = "S"
  }

  global_secondary_index {
    name     = "UserIdIndex"
    hash_key = "userId"
    range_key = "createdAt"
  }

  tags = var.tags
}

resource "aws_dynamodb_table" "purchases" {
  name           = "${var.table_prefix}-purchases"
  billing_mode   = "PAY_PER_REQUEST"
  hash_key       = "id"

  attribute {
    name = "id"
    type = "S"
  }

  attribute {
    name = "userId"
    type = "S"
  }

  global_secondary_index {
    name     = "UserIdIndex"
    hash_key = "userId"
    range_key = "purchaseDate"
  }

  tags = var.tags
}
```

**DynamoDB features that make you smile:**
- **Serverless** ‚Äî No database servers to manage ‚úÖ
- **Auto-scaling** ‚Äî Handles traffic spikes automatically ‚úÖ
- **JSON native** ‚Äî Perfect for variable receipt structures ‚úÖ
- **Fast queries** ‚Äî Single-digit millisecond latency ‚úÖ
- **Free tier friendly** ‚Äî 25 GB storage, 25 RCU/WCU ‚úÖ
resource "aws_security_group" "rds" {
  name_prefix = "${var.project_name}-rds-"
  
  # Only allow PostgreSQL traffic from our VPC
  ingress {
    from_port   = 5432
    to_port     = 5432
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["10.0.0.0/8"]
  }
}
```

**Database features that matter:**
- Automatic backups ‚úÖ
- Security groups ‚úÖ
- Encryption at rest ‚úÖ
- Managed updates ‚úÖ
- CloudWatch monitoring ‚úÖ

## The Deployment Scripts: Automation That Actually Works ü§ñ

Manual deployments are like manually calculating your taxes ‚Äî technically possible, but why would you torture yourself?

**Setup script (the "make it work" button):**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# scripts/setup.sh

echo "üöÄ Purchase Tracker Infrastructure Setup"

# Check prerequisites (because assumptions kill)
if ! command -v tofu &> /dev/null; then
    echo "‚ùå OpenTofu not installed"
    echo "Install with: brew install opentofu"
    exit 1
fi

# Initialize OpenTofu (the handshake)
tofu init

# Validate configuration (catch errors early)
tofu validate

# Plan deployment (see before you leap)
tofu plan -var-file="terraform.tfvars" -out=tfplan

# Confirm with human (because robots aren't perfect)
read -p "Deploy infrastructure? (yes/no): " confirm
if [ "$confirm" = "yes" ]; then
    tofu apply tfplan
    echo "üéâ Infrastructure deployed!"
fi
```

**The beauty of infrastructure as code:** Run the script, get coffee, come back to a fully deployed infrastructure. It's like having a really efficient intern who never makes mistakes.

## Cost Management: Staying in the Free Tier üí∏

AWS Free Tier is generous, but it's not infinite. Here's how to stay on the good side of $0:

**Free Tier Monitoring Dashboard:**
```bash
# Check S3 usage
aws s3 ls s3://your-bucket --recursive --human-readable --summarize

# Monitor RDS hours
aws rds describe-db-instances --query 'DBInstances[0].DBInstanceStatus'

# Check estimated charges
aws cloudwatch get-metric-statistics \
  --namespace AWS/Billing \
  --metric-name EstimatedCharges \
  --dimensions Name=Currency,Value=USD \
  --start-time $(date -d '1 day ago' +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S) \
  --end-time $(date +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S) \
  --period 86400 \
  --statistics Maximum
```

**Pro tips for staying free:**
- ‚úÖ Use `t3.micro` instances (free tier eligible)
- ‚úÖ Keep RDS storage ‚â§ 20 GB
- ‚úÖ Monitor S3 storage (5 GB limit)
- ‚úÖ Set up billing alerts at $5
- ‚úÖ Use lifecycle policies for old data
- ‚úÖ Stop development instances when not in use

## Security: Because Hackers Don't Take Holidays üîí

Security isn't an afterthought ‚Äî it's baked into every layer:

```hcl
# IAM policies with least privilege
resource "aws_iam_role_policy" "backend_service" {
  policy = jsonencode({
    Version = "2012-10-17"
    Statement = [
      {
        Effect = "Allow"
        Action = [
          "s3:GetObject",
          "s3:PutObject"  # Only what's needed
        ]
        Resource = "${var.s3_bucket_arn}/*"
      },
      {
        Effect = "Allow"
        Action = [
          "textract:AnalyzeDocument"  # Specific actions only
        ]
        Resource = "*"
      }
    ]
  })
}

# VPC security groups (the firewall)
resource "aws_security_group" "app" {
  # Only allow HTTPS traffic
  ingress {
    from_port   = 443
    to_port     = 443
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }
}
```

**Security layers:**
- **IAM roles** with minimal permissions
- **VPC** with private subnets
- **Security groups** as firewalls
- **Encryption** at rest and in transit
- **Cognito** for authentication
- **CloudTrail** for audit logs

## Monitoring: Know Before Your Users Do üìä

Good monitoring is like having a crystal ball that actually works:

```hcl
# CloudWatch alarms that matter
resource "aws_cloudwatch_metric_alarm" "high_cpu" {
  alarm_name          = "rds-high-cpu"
  comparison_operator = "GreaterThanThreshold"
  evaluation_periods  = "2"
  metric_name         = "CPUUtilization"
  threshold           = "80"
  alarm_description   = "RDS CPU is too high"
}

resource "aws_cloudwatch_metric_alarm" "billing_alarm" {
  alarm_name          = "billing-alert"
  comparison_operator = "GreaterThanThreshold"
  metric_name         = "EstimatedCharges"
  threshold           = "10"  # $10 safety net
  alarm_description   = "AWS charges exceeded $10"
}
```

**What we monitor:**
- üí∞ Billing (most important!)
- üî• CPU usage
- üíæ Storage utilization
- üîó Database connections
- üìä Application errors
- üöÄ Response times

## The Deployment Experience: From Zero to Hero üé¨

Here's what actually happens when you run the setup:

```bash
$ ./scripts/setup.sh

üöÄ Purchase Tracker Infrastructure Setup
========================================
‚úÖ Prerequisites check passed
üîß Initializing OpenTofu...
üîç Validating configuration...
üìã Planning deployment...

Plan: 23 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

‚ö†Ô∏è  Ready to deploy infrastructure
This will create AWS resources that may incur costs.
Review the plan above carefully.

Do you want to proceed with deployment? (yes/no): yes

üöÄ Deploying infrastructure...
‚úÖ Cognito User Pool created
‚úÖ S3 bucket created
‚úÖ DynamoDB tables created
‚úÖ IAM roles configured
‚úÖ CloudWatch alarms set

üéâ Infrastructure deployment completed!
========================================

Important outputs:
- Cognito User Pool ID: us-east-1_AbCdEfGhI
- S3 Bucket: purchase-tracker-receipts-dev-1a2b3c4d
- DynamoDB Tables: purchase-tracker-dev-users, purchase-tracker-dev-receipts, purchase-tracker-dev-purchases

Next steps:
1. Update your backend with new configuration
2. Run database migrations
3. Test the deployment

üíæ Configuration saved to backend/.env.infrastructure
üìä Monitor costs at: https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing/
```

**Total deployment time:** 5-10 minutes ‚è±Ô∏è  
**Total cost:** $0 üí∞  
**Developer happiness:** Priceless üòä

## What We've Built: The Full Stack Experience üèóÔ∏è

Our infrastructure gives us:

**üîê Authentication System**
- User registration/login
- Email verification
- Password reset
- Secure token management
- 50,000 MAU capacity

**üì∏ File Storage System**
- Receipt image upload
- Automatic encryption
- Cost optimization
- CDN-ready URLs
- 5 GB capacity

**üóÑÔ∏è Database System**
- Managed DynamoDB
- Automatic scaling
- Global secondary indexes
- CloudWatch monitoring
- 25 GB storage

**üîç OCR Processing**
- Receipt text extraction
- Expense categorization
- Data validation
- 1,000 pages/month

**üìä Monitoring & Alerts**
- Cost tracking
- Performance metrics
- Error monitoring
- Billing alerts

## Future-Proofing: Beyond the Free Tier üîÆ

What happens after 12 months? Don't panic ‚Äî the costs are surprisingly reasonable:

**Post-free-tier costs (estimated):**
- **DynamoDB:** ~$1-5/month (for moderate usage)
- **S3 storage:** ~$1/month (for 20 GB)
- **Data transfer:** ~$1/month (for moderate usage)
- **Cognito:** Still free! (up to 50K MAU)
- **Lambda:** Still free! (1M requests)

**Total:** ~$3-7/month for a production-ready application üí∏

**Scaling strategies:**
- Use DynamoDB on-demand billing for variable workloads
- Implement data archiving for old receipts to reduce storage costs
- Add CloudFront CDN for global performance
- Use Lambda for background processing
- Consider DynamoDB Global Tables for multi-region deployment

## Troubleshooting: When Things Go Sideways üõ†Ô∏è

**Common issues and solutions:**

**"Bucket name already exists"**
```bash
# S3 bucket names are globally unique
# Add a random suffix in your configuration
s3_bucket_name = "purchase-tracker-receipts-${random_id.suffix.hex}"
```

**"Database connection failed"**
```bash
# Check DynamoDB table exists and you have correct permissions
# Verify AWS credentials are configured properly
# Ensure table names match your configuration
```

**"Exceeded free tier limits"**
```bash
# Check AWS billing dashboard
# Review CloudWatch metrics
# Implement automatic resource cleanup
```

**"OpenTofu state locked"**
```bash
# If deployment fails and state is locked
tofu force-unlock LOCK_ID
```

## The Bottom Line: Infrastructure That Doesn't Suck ‚ú®

We've built something beautiful:

**‚úÖ Production-ready** ‚Äî Handles real traffic with real users  
**‚úÖ Cost-effective** ‚Äî $0 for development, ~$17/month for production  
**‚úÖ Secure** ‚Äî Multiple layers of security best practices  
**‚úÖ Scalable** ‚Äî Grows with your application  
**‚úÖ Maintainable** ‚Äî Version controlled, documented, repeatable  
**‚úÖ Monitored** ‚Äî Know what's happening before users complain  

**The best part?** You can deploy this entire infrastructure with a single command, tear it down just as easily, and sleep soundly knowing it follows AWS best practices.

## What's Next: The Infrastructure Journey Continues üõ£Ô∏è

Future improvements to consider:
- **Multi-region deployment** for global users
- **Blue-green deployments** for zero-downtime updates
- **Container orchestration** with ECS or EKS
- **CDN integration** with CloudFront
- **Advanced monitoring** with X-Ray tracing
- **Backup strategies** with cross-region replication

**TL;DR:** OpenTofu + AWS Free Tier + good practices = infrastructure that makes you look like a DevOps wizard while costing approximately nothing. üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
